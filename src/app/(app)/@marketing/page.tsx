            How do we create without inhibition? What would it look like to be
            in a space devoid of the outside world, a place where creativity
            becomes the centermost ideal? What would you write if you had
            nothing to distract?

          <p>
            An environment to write, journal, and take notes. No frills, minimal
            featuresâ€” no distractions. A simple interface built on top of a
            powerful text editor.

            Designed with a focus on simplicity, readability, keyboard
            accessbility, and a delightful experience, this should be a place to
            write without worry. Mostly built for me.

            Just a focus on the words.{' '}
